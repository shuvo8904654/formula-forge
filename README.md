Formula Forge

Formula Forge is a clean and interactive periodic table built with only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes all 118 elements, each color-coded by type, and you can click or hover over any element to see quick facts and full details. The search bar helps you find elements by name, symbol, or atomic number, and you can also filter by category. A temperature slider shows how each element changes state at different temperatures, and dark mode is available for easier viewing.

The site also comes with practical chemistry tools such as a molar mass calculator, equation balancer, pH and dilution calculators, a molarity tool, and a unit converter. For learning, it offers quizzes, an electron shell viewer, periodic trend explanations, and an element comparison feature. Everything works directly in the browser with no setup required. You can simply open index.html or run a small local server using Python if you prefer.

The project is made up of three files: index.html for the layout, styles.css for the design, and script.js for all logic and data. It works smoothly on all modern browsers and on mobile devices. You are free to use, modify, or share the project.
